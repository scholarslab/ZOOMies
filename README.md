# ZOOMies

https://scholarslab.github.io/ZOOMies/ displays a random GIF from r/zoomies.

The goal is to integrate this with SLab's Slack to give you a GIF every time you use the /zoom command to open a Zoom call from the Slack, and/or as a browser add-on (script? plugin? Applescript?) that opens a tab displaying a random r/zoomies GIF any time you enter a Zoom URL into a browser tab.
